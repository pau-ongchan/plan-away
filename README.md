**Why is this project of interest to you?**  
As an avid traveller and more often than not, the 
designated travel planner, I always found it 
hard to plan itineraries. Until today, I use Google 
sheets to create my itineraries. However, this is not
the most efficient nor is it user-friendly.
As such, I wanted to create an app that would 
serve as an all-in-one travel buddy. 

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to create a new itinerary.
- As a user, I want to add the names of the people going on my trip.
- As a user, I want to be able to add plans to my itinerary.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my itinerary.
- As a user, I want to be able to change my plans.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove plans from my itinerary.
- As a user, I want to be able to add costs in the budget tracker.
- As a user, I want to be able to divide the costs by the number of people.
- As a user, I want to view all my pasts itineraries.
- As a user, I want to add my thoughts on each of the places I visited.
- As a user, I want to add photos into a gallery of that itinerary.
- As a user, I want to add items into my packing list.
- As a user, I want to receive reminders about my trip.
- As a user, I want to have an offline currency converter 
that allows me to enter a number and gives back another number.
