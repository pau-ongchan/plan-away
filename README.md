**Why is this project of interest to you?**  
As an avid traveller and more often than not, the 
designated travel planner, I always found it 
hard to plan itineraries. Until today, I use Google 
sheets to create my itineraries. However, this is not
the most efficient nor is it user-friendly.
As such, I wanted to create an app that would 
serve as an all-in-one travel buddy.
